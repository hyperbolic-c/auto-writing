Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse search queries for academic literature research. These queries are intended for searching a local Zotero library containing scholarly papers, books, and research documents.

Instructions:
- Generate {number_queries} distinct queries that cover different aspects of the research topic.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect: background/theory, methodology, applications, recent developments, or related works.
- Queries should be specific enough to match relevant academic papers in a semantic search system.
- Prefer academic terminology and key concepts from the research topic.
- Don't generate similar queries - each should represent a different angle.

Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:
Topic: "What are the latest advances in mRNA vaccine technology"
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To comprehensively cover mRNA vaccine advances, we need queries covering different aspects: mechanism of action, delivery systems, clinical trials, and manufacturing challenges.",
    "query": [
        "mRNA vaccine mechanism of action lipid nanoparticles",
        "mRNA vaccine clinical trials 2024 2025",
        "mRNA vaccine manufacturing scale-up challenges",
        "self-amplifying mRNA vaccine technology advances"
    ]
}}
```
